In memory of my master thesis "Ermittlung von Nutzerverhalten an Elektrowerkzeugen anhand von Messdaten am Beispiel eines Akku-Bohrschraubers"

A short introduction: Some sensors, such as current sensors and inertial sensors, are built into a power tool. When the user uses the tool, the sensor collects the corresponding data/time series. By using machine learning algorithms to classify the time series, it is possible to know what actions the user performs with the power tool.
